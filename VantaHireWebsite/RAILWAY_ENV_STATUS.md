- Email: 9/9 ✅
- File Upload: 3/3 ✅
- Forms Feature: 4/4 ✅
- Scheduler: 2/2 ✅
- Database: 1/1 ✅

## ✅ Ready for Production

All critical environment variables are configured correctly. The application is ready for:

1. ✅ Secure authentication (SESSION_SECRET, ADMIN_PASSWORD)
2. ✅ Email sending (Brevo SMTP fully configured)
3. ✅ File uploads (Cloudinary configured)
4. ✅ Forms feature (BASE_URL + tuning parameters set)
5. ✅ Rate limiting (public form endpoints protected)
6. ✅ Automated tasks (scheduler enabled)
7. ✅ Host validation (ALLOWED_HOSTS configured)

---

## 🔧 Verification Steps

### 1. Restart Service (Apply New Variables)

```bash
# Redeploy to apply new environment variables
railway up
```

Or trigger redeploy in Railway dashboard.

### 2. Check Logs After Restart

```bash
railway logs
```

**Look for:**
- ✅ `✅ ATS schema ready`
- ✅ `✅ Forms schema ready`
- ✅ `serving on port 3000` (or Railway-assigned port)
- ✅ No errors about missing environment variables

### 3. Test Forms Feature

**Send Test Form:**
```
1. Navigate to: https://improved-tribble-production.up.railway.app/admin/forms
2. Create test template
3. Go to /jobs/:id/applications
4. Send form to test email
5. Check email for form link
6. Expected link format: https://improved-tribble-production.up.railway.app/form/{token}
```

**Verify:**
- ✅ Email received
- ✅ Form link uses HTTPS (no mixed content warnings)
- ✅ Form loads correctly
- ✅ Submission works
- ✅ Response visible in Forms modal

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Forms Feature Now Live

With `BASE_URL` set, the Forms feature is **fully operational**:

- ✅ Form invitations can be sent
- ✅ Emails contain clickable HTTPS links
- ✅ Public forms load at `/form/{token}`
- ✅ Rate limiting active (10 req/min public, 50/day invitations)
- ✅ Invitations expire after 14 days

### Email Deliverability

**Brevo SMTP is configured**, but verify:

1. **SPF Record** for `vantahire.com`:
   ```
   v=spf1 include:spf.brevo.com ~all
   ```

2. **DKIM Record** - Check Brevo dashboard for DNS records

3. **DMARC Record** (optional but recommended):
   ```
   v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@vantahire.com
   ```

**Test email delivery:**
```bash
# Send test email to yourself
railway run node -e "
const { getEmailService } = require('./dist/simpleEmailService');
(async () => {
  const emailService = await getEmailService();
  await emailService.sendEmail({
    to: 'your-email@example.com',
    subject: 'Test from VantaHire',
    text: 'This is a test email from production.'
  });
})();
"
```

### Health Check

Railway health check is configured: `/api/health`

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-24T..."
}
```

## 📊 Next Steps

Now that environment is configured:

1. **Redeploy Service** (apply new variables)
2. **Run Seed Scripts** (optional - default templates)
   ```bash
   railway run npm run seed:forms
   ```
3. **Test Forms End-to-End** (see verification steps above)
4. **Monitor Logs** for first 24 hours
5. **Announce to Users** after successful testing
